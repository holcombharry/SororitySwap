        "The most common question I’m asked is:",
        "What was it like being president?",
        "I dread the question because, with all honesty, there is no definite way I can answer it. How do I sum up a year’s worth of memories and experiences into a two second response? I’ve tried to come up with an answer that can explain everything, but it seems impossible. The mini versions of myself are rushing around in my brain, collecting all my presidency files like secretary SpongeBob. ",
        "But, as I sit here writing this, I’ve come up with an answer that requires an explanation and no explanation at the same time. ",
        "It was life changing. ",
        "I know that answer may seem over the top or cliché, but it’s the truth. My experience changed my outlook on so many different aspects of life. ",
        "There are several things in life I take for granted. One of the most important is time. I swear, no matter how hard I try, I never live in the moment. I always worry about the future and that will forever be my fatal flaw. ",
        "If there was one thing I could have asked for, it would be more time with the women in my sorority. Leading them, watching them become courageous, influential women, was the greatest gift I was given, and I wish I had more time. My experience in this position has allowed me to see that time is such a precious thing in life. As I look back on the time I spent with them, I can’t help but be grateful for everything they’ve given me. They trusted me with this position even though I held none previously. They offered help when I needed it. They came to me for advice and opinions. They allowed me to watch them grow. ",
        "Of course, there were difficulties in my position. Issues arose and I was terrified to deal with them. But it seemed, no matter how terrified I was, the women in my sorority weren’t terrified at all. They were hopeful and honest. They had faith in me which only made me want to work ten times harder. The truth is, without the love and respect from these women, I wouldn’t have made it as president. ",
        "The position taught much about the reality of our world. It taught me about the people I may encounter in the workforce. I learned how to handle difficult situations and conversations. I continuously increased my knowledge about finances, contracts, and business proposals. I learned how to abide by the bylaws and communicate effectively with those higher up working for my sorority. It forced me out of my comfort zone, allowing me to create amazing relationships with my school or sorority advisors. It helped me organize myself and my work and even showed me that I do not, no matter how hard I try, rely on a calendar planner. Sometimes, my biggest fear came true, and I messed up, but it taught me that it’s okay to make mistakes. It’s the only way you learn. ",
        "So, when people ask me what it was like being president, how do I respond?",
        "It was good but there were also bad moments. But those bad moments truly turned into an amazing outcome and learning experience. It wasn’t easy but it wasn’t hard because I had the love and support of my sisters. It wasn’t slow because now looking back, time went by so quickly that I almost wish I could watch it happen again just to make sure I actually lived it.",
        "The person I was before I became president is no longer the person I am now. Whether you have a position or not, time continues to push you forward, changing who you were into who you are. ",
        "It was life changing.  "

        "If you have ever gone thrifting you know that it is not a one and done shopping experience. It takes time and effort to find the things you truly love, but that is what makes it worth it. When I go thrifting, there are a few sections I always find myself in: mens button downs, ladies topics and mens blazers.",
        "In these sections I am hoping to find staple quality pieces to add to my everyday wardrobe. An oversized button down is the perfect layering piece for any season. A vintage tank top is such a fun way to spice up a night out, don’t be afraid to crop it! Lastly a structured quality oversized mens blazer can be worn on a night out or to work. ",
