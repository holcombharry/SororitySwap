        "The most common question I’m asked is:",
        "What was it like being president?",
        "I dread the question because, with all honesty, there is no definite way I can answer it. How do I sum up a year’s worth of memories and experiences into a two second response? I’ve tried to come up with an answer that can explain everything, but it seems impossible. The mini versions of myself are rushing around in my brain, collecting all my presidency files like secretary SpongeBob. ",
        "But, as I sit here writing this, I’ve come up with an answer that requires an explanation and no explanation at the same time. ",
        "It was life changing. ",
        "I know that answer may seem over the top or cliché, but it’s the truth. My experience changed my outlook on so many different aspects of life. ",
        "There are several things in life I take for granted. One of the most important is time. I swear, no matter how hard I try, I never live in the moment. I always worry about the future and that will forever be my fatal flaw. ",
        "If there was one thing I could have asked for, it would be more time with the women in my sorority. Leading them, watching them become courageous, influential women, was the greatest gift I was given, and I wish I had more time. My experience in this position has allowed me to see that time is such a precious thing in life. As I look back on the time I spent with them, I can’t help but be grateful for everything they’ve given me. They trusted me with this position even though I held none previously. They offered help when I needed it. They came to me for advice and opinions. They allowed me to watch them grow. ",
        "Of course, there were difficulties in my position. Issues arose and I was terrified to deal with them. But it seemed, no matter how terrified I was, the women in my sorority weren’t terrified at all. They were hopeful and honest. They had faith in me which only made me want to work ten times harder. The truth is, without the love and respect from these women, I wouldn’t have made it as president. ",
        "The position taught much about the reality of our world. It taught me about the people I may encounter in the workforce. I learned how to handle difficult situations and conversations. I continuously increased my knowledge about finances, contracts, and business proposals. I learned how to abide by the bylaws and communicate effectively with those higher up working for my sorority. It forced me out of my comfort zone, allowing me to create amazing relationships with my school or sorority advisors. It helped me organize myself and my work and even showed me that I do not, no matter how hard I try, rely on a calendar planner. Sometimes, my biggest fear came true, and I messed up, but it taught me that it’s okay to make mistakes. It’s the only way you learn. ",
        "So, when people ask me what it was like being president, how do I respond?",
        "It was good but there were also bad moments. But those bad moments truly turned into an amazing outcome and learning experience. It wasn’t easy but it wasn’t hard because I had the love and support of my sisters. It wasn’t slow because now looking back, time went by so quickly that I almost wish I could watch it happen again just to make sure I actually lived it.",
        "The person I was before I became president is no longer the person I am now. Whether you have a position or not, time continues to push you forward, changing who you were into who you are. ",
        "It was life changing.  "

        "If you have ever gone thrifting you know that it is not a one and done shopping experience. It takes time and effort to find the things you truly love, but that is what makes it worth it. When I go thrifting, there are a few sections I always find myself in: mens button downs, ladies topics and mens blazers.",
        "In these sections I am hoping to find staple quality pieces to add to my everyday wardrobe. An oversized button down is the perfect layering piece for any season. A vintage tank top is such a fun way to spice up a night out, don’t be afraid to crop it! Lastly a structured quality oversized mens blazer can be worn on a night out or to work. ",

        "To start off our new series, Sorority Spotlight, we will be taking a look at the first chapter to coin the term “sorority”; Gamma Phi Beta. The sorority was founded on November 11th, 1874, by Frances E. Haven, Helen Dodge, Adeline Curtis, and Mary Bingham. Expanding nationally over the following decades, Gamma Phi Beta became one of the seven founding members of the National Panhellenic Conference’s (NPC) in 1891. The NPC stands today as one of the oldest and largest women’s membership organizations, including 26 sororities and representing over 4 million members.",
        "Gamma Phi Beta’s colors are pink (blush) and brown (a-la-mode), the official flower is a pink carnation, and the symbol is the crescent moon. Their Gamma Phi Beta badge was designed by Tiffany & Co in 1874, and is known around the panhellenic community for its beautiful design.",
        "The sorority currently has over 224,00 members, with an international headquarters based in Centennial, Colorado. At this headquarters, there is a Gamma Phi Beta museum that holds important artifacts to the chapter’s history.",
        "The impact of Gamma Phi Beta reaches far beyond the bounds of its members, continuing to serve as an industry leader in philanthropy. The sorority has recently partnered with Girls on the Run, a non profit organization that strives for a physical activity-based positive youth development (PA-PYD) program designed to enhance girls’ social, emotional and physical skills and behaviors to successfully navigate life experiences.",
        "The members of Gamma Phi Beta have continued to pioneer female excellence in numerous industries over the years, with notable members of the sorority including: Alex Flanagan(sports reporter for ESPN), Jennifer Dunn (Former US Congresswoman), Laurel Clark(NASA Astronaut), and Marguerite Higgins(Pulitzer Prize Winner). If you are interested in learning more about Gamma Phi Beta, check out their official website at https://www.gammaphibeta.org/.",

        "During my freshman year of college, my roommate asked me one question: Are you going through recruitment?",
        "After asking her what it was, it sounded like something everyone did when they first came to college. So, I agreed to sign up with her.",
        "I was terrified for the first round. I wasn’t sure what to wear and, as an already quiet person, I had no idea what to expect with conversations. The thought of talking to people for hours on end was paralyzing, but I did it. I went through recruitment and received a bid from Sigma Kappa.",
        "Looking back from then, when I had no clue about Greek Life, to now, being my last year in Sigma Kappa, I’m absolutely amazed at what I’ve realized.",
        "*First Things First",
        "As it goes for anything, you get what you put out. In my first two years, I didn’t put much effort into being in a sorority. At first, I wasn’t sure why I was in the sorority, but, then again, I wasn’t sure why I would leave. I had some friends. I had fun at the events. I got a little who turned out to be the perfect match for me. But even with these factors, I wasn’t doing much.",
        "During my junior year, something clicked. For some unknown reason, I ran for a position that allowed me to decorate the room for recruitment. In order to make our room look as well-put together and welcoming as possible, I had to put in the work. Putting in the effort for the room led me to put in effort for recruitment which in turn helped me encourage other girls and allowed me to make friends.",
        "The effort that I put into this allowed me to gain so much love for the sorority. I made new friends, got the courage to speak up or talk to other women in the panhellenic community, and used my love for art to help paint the letters. All the work that I put into the sorority showed me what I was missing—the opportunity to be recognized.",
        "Maybe that was what I was afraid of all along—not being seen.",
        "After this position, I gained courage in myself to run for a higher one. My faith in my ability to lead the chapter as president was slim, but that brings me to second my realization.",
        "*You Have to Grow",
        "In order to achieve anything, whether it be personal, academic or professional goals, you have to grow. Each experience lived through changes you as a person and that is perfectly okay. As humans, we are unable to stay the exact same way our entire life. There is a chance that you won’t be able to see how much you grow, but others will. The women of my sorority saw how much I grew from recruitment alone and trusted me with the position of president.",
        "Within this position, I grew to an extent I never thought possible. My confidence in myself had increased, talking to others became easy for me, and excitement filled my body when events were happening.",
        "How was I able to change so much?",
        "Well, I finally had the courage to...",
        "*Stop Pretending",
        "The most important realization that came from being in a sorority was that I stopped pretending to be someone I wasn’t.",
        "There was a fear inside of me that I was chosen to be in Sigma Kappa because of the person I was perceived to be during recruitment. Perhaps I didn’t realize this fear my freshman and sophomore year, but I was able to see it as I grew. The person I was in my years of questioning my time in the sorority was the person I was trying to be to fit in.",
        "Never pretend to be someone you’re not.",
        "Do not compromise your true self out of fear.",
        "Just as humans are unable to remain the same, a part of who we truly are will always shine through.",
